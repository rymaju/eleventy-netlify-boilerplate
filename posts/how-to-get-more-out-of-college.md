I get a few messages from incoming freshman about how to prepare for college. My answer will always be the same: read. Its advice I _wish_ someone told me my first year.

Back then I was bored out of my mind, I didn't know what to do and worst of all I was itching to learn more but didn't know where to start! Little did I know that there is an endless treasure trove of books and blogs that could have exponentially increased my ability as a programmer.

I discovered the power of reading last March when the pandemic hit. The transition to online was rough, and I ended up having a lot more free time than I had before. It was also about time to choose courses, so I thought I might read about some of the courses I was going to take over the summer.

Over the course of about a month, I read through the entirety of Head First Design Patterns, Effective Java, and Algorithms. Once I actually took the classes, I realized that I already _knew_ much of the content of the course, giving me the freedom to focus on learning the practical mechanical skill of actually implementing and applying the content to the homework. It was amazing. For once, I didn't feel lost or surprised every lecture. I knew where things were heading and by the time I heard the content the second time it was already deeply ingrained in my brain.

Most people forget that the vast majority of work for computer science classes, especially early on, is just regurgitating content from lectures. Its spending the time learning the _what_ and _why_. But knowing is prerequisite to _doing_. By introducing yourself to the content sooner, even just a bit, you gain an insane advantage when actually taking the course.

You get _more_ out of college by front loading the content, leaving you time to excel on homeworks and exams. The best part? You genuinely know and can _do_ more than if you had just taken the course normally.

To Northeastern students (and any other computer science major) I recommend reading these books:

- [How to Design Programs](http://htdp.org/)
- Head First Design Patterns
- Effective Java
- [Algorithms](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/)
- [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
- Essentials of Programming Languages
- The Pragmatic Programmer (This book is **amazing**, something every software developer should read in their 2nd or 3rd year of college)
